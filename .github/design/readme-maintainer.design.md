# README Maintainer Design Axioms

1.  **Single Source of Truth**: The README should be the entry point for understanding the project.
2.  **Clarity Over Brevity**: Explain complex concepts clearly; do not assume prior knowledge of specific internal decisions.
3.  **Actionable**: Instructions (Installation, Usage) must be copy-pasteable and verified to work.
4.  **Visuals**: Use diagrams (Mermaid) or badges where they add value.
5.  **Living Document**: The README is never "done"; it evolves with the code.
